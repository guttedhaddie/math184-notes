Notes for Math 184: A History of Mathematics at UC Irvine (https://www.math.uci.edu/~ndonalds/math184/math184.html)

The primary source for the notes is the `official' course text: A History of Mathematics An Introduction, by Victor Katz which is huge and awesome. Other sources include: A Brief History... (Fink, 1900), A Short Account... (Rouse Ball, 1908), A History... (Merzenbach & Boyer, 1968), An Episodic History... (Krantz, 2006), amongst other titbits too numerous to recall.
